You are one of the few that have survived and now you must search this new wasteland in order to fight for your life against what is left of the indigenous population now infected with the disease. Go solo, team up with friends or take on the world, as you choose your path in this brutal and chilling landscape using whatever means you stumble upon to survive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">This is DayZ, this is your story.</h2>\r\r<br>DayZ is a gritty, authentic, open-world survival horror hybrid-MMO game, in which players follow a single goal: to survive in the harsh post-apocalyptic landscape as long as they can.

Every decision matters, there are no save games, no extra lives, every mistake can be lethal. If you fail, you lose everything and you need to play again from the beginning with nothing but your wits, and your two hands.

We want to really bring the world to life with the variety of fauna.\r<br></li><li>More trapping and hunting options.\r<br></li><li>Expanded A.I. - We’re trying some really cool stuff for our AI, and plan to keep it evolving and improving over the alpha.\r<br></li><li>More areas to explore -

Vegas. New Vegas.<br>\t\t\t\t\tIt’s the kind of town where you dig your own grave prior to being shot in the head and left for dead…and that’s before things really get ugly. It’s a town of dreamers and desperados being torn apart by warring factions vying for complete control of this desert oasis.

Set in a believable future, you take on the role of an elite operative handpicked to join Project IM, a top secret military program being assembled to protect mankind from all dangers outside our solar system. \r<br>\r<br>Interstellar Marines is inspired by movies such as Aliens, Starship Troopers and Final Fantasy; and games such as Half-Life, System Shock 2, and Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield. Interstellar Marines is all about evolving the FPS recipe with all the inspirations we've assimilated since the birth of the genre. Our goal is an evolutionary leap forward driven by our compulsive interest in science fiction, role-playing, military realism, and respect for first person immersion.\r<br>\r<br><i>*role-playing not yet implemented</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Welcome to Project: IM</strong></h2>\r\r<br>Since man first raised his head to the stars above, he has dreamed of conquering space. Interstellar Marines is the age old dream come true. It is the dawn of the 22nd century, a time of great hopes and expectations. The discovery of a new and inexhaustible well of power known as Zero Point Energy has revolutionized space travel. Man has escaped the confines of Mother Earth, and gone on to colonize the solar system.\r<br>\r<br>But far away from public awareness an ambitious military project has already taken Man beyond the final frontier, and into the regions of the stars. The powerful Interplanetary Treaty Organization, ITO, is secretly constructing the first human settlement in another star system. You are a new member of the Interstellar Marines, a secret battalion within the ITO special forces created to protect humanity against potential threats from the confines of the unknown universe. \r<br>\r<br>Now gear up Marine, we’ve got training to do! Welcome to Project IM.\r<br>\r<br><strong>New Hell Week Event</strong>\r<br>\r<br>Featuring 9 New and unique areas where 64 players battle until only 4 are left standing! This event runs every 3 hours in each timezone, so there’s always one somewhere in the world starting at the top of every hour.  We also have a Steam Leaderboard for Hell Week here which tracks Combat Points globally, monthly, and survivors of Hell Week. We'll let you know more about Hell Week Finals when it’s ready.\r<br>\r<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/stats/236370/leaderboards/804133/&quot;\"  ><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/236370/extras/HW_LDRBRDS_1b_616.png?t=1452057388\">\r</a>\r<br>\r<br><strong>7 Singleplayer/Co-op Missions</strong>\r<br>\r<br>Play 5 co-op and single-player missions against unscripted AI with dynamic environment effects or two pivotal missions inside the Interstellar Marines universe, The NeuroGen Incident and Assault on Starcrown Aerospace. Play singleplayer or co-op with up to three friends in intense action with more co-op and singleplayer missions to come! \r<br>\r<br><strong>9 Unique Multiplayer Maps Across 3 Game Modes</strong>\r<br>\r<br>Take your friends out in Deadlock, Deathmatch, and Team Deathmatch on maps featuring dynamic environment effects such as time of day, rain, thunder and lightning, emergency lighting, fire alarms, moving platforms etc.\r<br>\r<br><strong>Realistic Simulation</strong>\r<br>\r<br>With a physics-based dynamic character controller there are no floating hands, and you can even see your feet! The physically present combat helmet has a HUD projected onto the visor and is affected by dust, rain, fogging, and damage. Aim down the sight for the long shots and use the tactical laser to assist aim when hip firing, as there are no artificial crosshairs to break immersion. Use the intuitive crouch and cover system; spacebar (default) peeks over cover, and looking down leans you forward to see over ledges. You can also shoot out the lights and prowl in darkness, or use the tactical flashlight if you’re afraid of the dark.\r<br>\r<br>We hope you enjoy the game, and look forward to developing it with you

Drive, bomb, rappel and shoot your way through eleven high octane levels.\r<br>\r<br>Command attack dogs, deploy breaching charges, perform drive-bys and control hostage situations!\r<br>\r<br>From the brilliant mind of Minh “Gooseman” Le, the co-creator of the seminal team-based FPS Counter-Strike, comes its spiritual successor, Tactical Intervention. Take your role as either terrorist or counter-terrorist and confront opponents in fierce and frantic combat over a variety of high energy maps wielding authentic real world weapons, from the classic P90 to the terrorist favourite, the AK47.\r<br>\r<br>Featuring unique games modes and mechanics not seen in other shooters, Tactical Intervention allows you to experience first person combat from an entirely new perspective. Hijack a car to take part in an intense highway chase; unload your high-powered Gabard shotgun at the VIP while leaning out the window, as your opponents scramble to protect him. Take out the covering helicopter with a well-placed shot from an RPG while you handbrake turn to broadside your target.\r<br>\r<br>Experience the thrill of rappelling down a building, kicking in the plexiglass, hurling a flash bang, grabbing a hostage as a human shield, and dealing some rapid fire death with your Uzi. Use riot shields to defend yourself against enemy forces and then command your vicious German Shepard attack dog to savage terrorists out of line of sight.

Get used to wanting to assassinate everyone in your near vicinity. <br>3) You'll already gave uninstalled the game at least twice, in utter exasperation and in utter hope of cleansing your life from this game. But you can't, you'll always go back.<br><br>The community is utterly merciless and beastly, with over half the people being angry 12 year old Russians. The betting will completely waste you and rip you of all of your favourite 50p worth of skins. And the trading is completely unreliable, leaving you to deal with steam support, which is 10x more brutal than the game itself. <br><br>But of course you’ll go back, it’s CS:GO, it’s a drug. A soul destroying, mind numbing, murder spree inducing drug.","review":"negative"},{"content":"The game is a money pit filled with hackers. <br>The rank system is a joke.<br>Overwatch is a joke.<br>VAC is a joke.<br>There is no anti-cheat system for this game<br>It has a tired engine. (12+ yrs)<br>It's a game based off a skill game, Just when you master a skill or skills they just throw in another broke update<br> and break more crap like changing the whole gun skill set (joke)<br><br>Adding the R8, A gun never in any Counter Strike, Is maybe all you need to know about the brain trust behind the game anymore. Best idea ever !  (Not)<br>I know lets add Flintlocks,Muzzleloaders,Catapult and Slingshots.<br><br>They will claim to fix things like broke spawns (Dust DM spawn) still broke !<br><br>DM (Deathmatch) has the Worst spawns of any game i have ever seen.<br>After one of the great updates you will have to play through weeks of people who have pings from another planet.<br>Random lag spikes or micro stutters, do to it's not optimized well.<br>Could it be a good game ? yes ! If they had someone who had a brain and played it and then fixed it and left it alone <br> other then adding the money making garbage (I know you only care if it's a cash cow).<br>Legit players suffer while hackers roam free. (I know you don't care cause you make more money) not banning people <br> hence people having so many accounts.<br><br>I have 1 account and proud of it.<br><br>I know people will hate on me and I don't care it's the truth......<br><br>By the way i'd spend more money through Steam but after seeing what this game has turned out to be and the stupid taxes crap from selling the junk I get from game (not real money by the way, that has already been taxed) and the lack of caring about hackers.    &quot; I'll just save it&quot;.<br><br>If your a legit player wanting to learn the game and enjoy the game you will be disappointed and penalized.<br>If you a hacker or a scammer you will love this game and be rewarded...<br><br><br>If you look at most of the positive reviews they are from people who have close to no hours played.<br>If you look at the negative reviews they are from people who put a lot of time into the game.<br><br><br>(1/7/15 update)  They added gloves to CSGO... Must have been why everyone was deranking, The old ones wore out.... Can't wait for Stat Trak Clown shoes...!<br><br><br>For all the noobs that cry that I have so many hours.<br>I've played since beta so that would be before the release August 21, 2012. The game now, Is not the game it used to be. Started going down hill once they added skins, Not for Steam but for players.<br>If it was still good I'd have many more hours then I do.<br>And yes I still play a little when my real good friend asks me too. Other then that I dont touch it anymore.......<br>As soon as my good friend is done playing CSGO I'll uninstall....!<br><br>&quot;I never leave a friend or a man behind&quot; (In other words I don't bail on my friends)<br><br><br>After reading a lot of the reviews I found that so many of them are negative with the thumbs up icon. So it ends up this game receives more positive reviews then it should.<br><br>If this game was left alone, With a fixed rank system &quot;Except for the mostly ulgy skins they add for more money&quot;  people who really cared about learning and playing like a team the way was ment to be played !<br>This game would be great........<br> There is a Mute/Block for thoses who don't want to know how many times your mom has had sex with a 12 yr old. <br>But 90% of everyone you face has brand new account and has the reflexes of god and X-Ray vision of Superman. No one gets banned. Hackers will say I heard you or it's my smurf.

Not only swallowing up updetes has been painful, but also watching how problems arent adressed for yeras. But when volvo try to take care of issue, you can be shure that it will be one step in the right direction and atleast 3 steps backwards (ladders and hitboxes, sound, etc.). Eventually picture makes sense - brain cell non existence of humanity has been taken to whole new level. <br><br>In the end there was only one ingredient that was necesasry.

Not so sure. <br><br>Nonethless about game itself, its been amazing years together with pro scene, lets hope that one day this game will become a truly great e-sports title and in 2016 it will not be destroyed by someones greed and careless, because with todays features this game have potential atleast to be as good as Counter Strike 1.6 still is.","review":"negative"},{"content":"10/10 best raging russian simulator.<br>Polish people included.","review":"positive"},{"content":"Here's what you learn and get with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, for free!<br><br>- Rage simulator 2016<br>- Study Russian Language without living in Russia<br>- Learn how to spend hundreds of dollars on a virtual knife that doesn't exist outside your monitor<br>- First-hand experience of schizophrenia<br>- Become bipolar<br>- Gain a habit of changing mouse every month<br>- Search 144Hz monitors<br>- Learn whats the best way to break keyboards<br>- Learn a 14 years old is going to ♥♥♥♥ you<br>- Next learn he is going to kill your family<br>- Think about what your kitchen knife would look like if it was put into the game<br>- Realize that you are going insane<br>- Lose several matches and get angry<br>- Try to relax and join another game<br>- Finally start winning<br>- Then start losing because your teammates cant keep it up<br>- Rage<br>- Punch the desk like its your arch enemy<br>- Bite your shirt<br>- Realize that you are really going insane<br>- Think of whats happening to you<br>- You have become a monster<br>- Find out its because of the game<br>- Something tells you it is best to uninstall the game<br>- Promise yourself you wont play it again<br>- After a few days you get back to normal life<br>- After some time you hear there's an update<br>- You pretend like you are not interested<br>- Think what could possibly go wrong if you start playing again<br>- Promise yourself you wont rage and go crazy again<br>- Install the game<br>- Repeat the list<br><br>Congratulations!
